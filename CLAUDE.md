## Commands
- Build: TBD (no build system detected yet)
- Run: TBD (no run command detected yet)
- Test: TBD (no test framework detected yet)
- Lint: TBD (no linter detected yet)

## Code Style Guidelines
- Project appears to be a Hyperledger DID (Decentralized Identity) demo
- Follow standard JavaScript/TypeScript conventions if implementing:
  - Use camelCase for variables and functions
  - Use PascalCase for classes and components
  - Use descriptive names that reflect purpose
  - Document public APIs with JSDoc comments
  - Handle errors explicitly and provide meaningful error messages
  - Prefer async/await for asynchronous operations
  - Use strong typing when available

## Repository Structure
- Currently minimal, only containing a README.md
- When creating new files, organize logically by feature or component

## Notes
- This appears to be a new project for demonstrating Hyperledger and Decentralized Identity concepts
